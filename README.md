# Mainflux Bootstrap service application example

This a **basic application** that gets the configuration from the
[Mainflux](https://mainflux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [bootstrap
server](https://github.com/mainflux/mainflux/tree/master/bootstrap#bootstrap-service),
displays it and sends and receives few test messages. The idea is to use
Mainflux credentials related to a thing that represents our physical device and
channels connected to that thing in order to send messages programmatically,
i.e. via our basic app. For more information, please see [this
guide](https://medium.com/mainflux-iot-platform/mainflux-bootstrap-service-a140d5f4c60d).
